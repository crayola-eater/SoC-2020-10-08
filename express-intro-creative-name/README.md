# Intro To Express

## Part 1: Installing Express On Your Node Project

Go to http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html and follow the instructions to install express on your node project.

## Part 2: Setting up a 'Hello World' server.

Our aim for this project is to follow the 'Hello World' steps on the Express documentation: http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html. By following the example we will create a functioning server that returns the text 'Hello World!' when you navigate to the localhost port on the browser.

## Part 3: Understanding the code.

Did you copy and paste the code from the Express documentation like it suggested? Congratulations, you've succesfully followed the docs! However, it will be useful for you to have some understanding of each of its component parts. Comment each line of code in the server with an explanation of what each part is doing.

## Part 4: Internalising the code.

Delete all of your code, but not your comments. Try and write out your 'Hello World' server again from memory.

## Part 5: Customising the server.

In the future, you'll probably want your servers to do more than send back some text to display on a webpage. Think about all the APIs we've used so far on the bootcamp, and dream for a moment about what kind of sweet API you could build yourself. Then, quickly ground those dreams in cold hard reality. Kidding! They can literally do anything you want them to.

Customise your Express server so that, instead of sending te string text 'Hello World', you send a JSON object with the key/value pair: `message: 'Hello World'`
